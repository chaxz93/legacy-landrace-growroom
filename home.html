  <img src='https://cryptocannabis.app/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/TRC20Port.gif'>
  <h2>Processing:</h2>
  <p>Cured Afghani buds are pale to medium green with a preponderance of orange hairs and a thick coating of trichomes. They should be very resinous and tacky to the touch.</p>
  <h2>Marketplace Infuence:</h2>
  <p>Patients most commonly turn to this potent indica to treat insomnia, pain, and stress disorders. Perfected and balanced over centuries by both natural selection and human cultivation, this vintage variety was likely brought to the west before Afghanistan banned cannabis production in 1973 under pressure from the Nixon administration. Afghani has been used to breed popular child strains like Northern Lights and Blueberry, both Cannabis Cup winners(Source: Leafly). Afghani is a classic for a reason - its heavy resin output has made it a traditional choice for the manufacture of hash. You don’t need a processed concentrate to appreciate the effects though (Source: WikiLeaf).</p>
  <h2>Genetic Note:</h2>
  <p>With a sweet, earthy aroma, Afghani delivers a deep, sedating relaxation and euphoria. In the frenzied market for new crossbred strains, this building block strain - also known as Afghani #1 - can be harder to come by.  THC content is high at 15 to 20% and the CBD level is 0.6%.</p>
  <h2>Growing/Breeding Diffuculty:</h2>
  <p>Afghani is a convenient indoor grow, with its short, bushy stalks ranging between 2 and 4 feet high. Plants can produce a rapid high yield - flowering typically begins around week 8, with a full harvest possible at the 4 month mark. Although the strain is endemic to a mountainous Central Asian climate, it can be grown outdoors along similar latitudes. Look for dense, conical colas as the plants mature.</p>

  <h2>Processing:</h2>
  <p>Depending on where in the continent the strain is grown, African buds can vary from pepper shaped and piecey to short, dense nugs with lots of leafy greens. Typically they are neon green with bright orange hairs and offer a crystal coating of amber trichomes and light, sweet resin. The THC levels of African bud fall pretty consistently around 10% regardless of its home state(Source: wikileaf).</p>
  <h2>Marketplace Infuence:</h2>
  <p>Offering some of the best 100% pure sativas the world has to offer, this landrace series native to the motherland is energizing, uplifting, and tasty. Because of the powerful euphoria associated with this strain, it is often prescribed for users that suffer from depression and chronic stress disorder. It is also a stimulant making it great for people who suffer from anorexia or a general lack of appetite. African is a great strain for new or novice smokers as it is a mellow smoke with uplifting effects that exclude the scattered thoughts of some sativas.</p>
  <h2>Genetic Note:</h2>
  <p>Citrus and lavender tend to be the most prominent notes within the strain, but hints of earth, wood, and flowers are also common. Regardless of its home state African is brightly flavored with heavy spice and herbal notes and a sweet sugary base (Source: wikileaf).</p>
  <h2>Growing/Breeding Diffuculty:</h2>
  <p>This plant is indigenous to African climates and therefore is best suited for hot weather or temperature controlled systems. It is recommended for advanced growers and is expected to have an above average yield with exact amounts depending on where your seeds originate from. In all honesty, it just might be the kind of strain you opt to purchase instead of growing yourself, although if you’re up for a bit of a challenge more power to you!</p>

  <h2>Processing:</h2>
  <p>Flowers of Central American strains are generally small to medium in size and have an elongated, spindly formation characteristic of other pure sativas.</p>
  <h2>Marketplace Infuence:</h2>
  <p>Cured flowers of this landrace strain have a certain earthy, musky scent that’s similar to damp soil. A closer inspection brings out a sharper edge, somewhat like skunk or gasoline. Grinding up the flowers intensifies these funky odors. Additionally, this bud’s high-powered mental effects may lead smokers to find unexpected commonalities between seemingly unrelated concepts or to group their thoughts or ideas into categories. All this cerebral stimulation can allow for extended work on complex, detailed tasks, whether they’re required for work or have to do with personal projects. Great for creative thinking for those engaged in original artistic work or in brainstorming sessions. Physically speaking, this strain can relieve pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. The strains anti-inflammatory properties can take care of more everyday discomforts like cramps. Because it can bring about a fairly obsessive, paranoid mindset, Central American is not a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance(Source: wikileaf).</p>
  <h2>Genetic Note:</h2>
  <p>Central American bud can be somewhat harsh and may tickle the palate or sinuses. This smoke has an earthy and woody flavor with a creamy mouthfeel on the exhale.</p>
  <h2>Growing/Breeding Diffuculty:</h2>
  <p>Because the name Central American covers a diffuse range of plant varieties, seeds have not been made widely available for sale. Those looking to grow this landrace should obtain clippings that can be fostered as clones; they should also live in a tropical climate similar to Central America where this strain is found(Source: wikileaf).</p>

  <h1>Hindu Kush</h1>
  <p>Hindu Kush is a pure indica strain named after the mountain range stretching 500 miles between Pakistan and Afghanistan where it originated (Source: Leafly). One of the original landrace strains that precipitated the popularization of cannabis throughout the world, Hindu Kush is a potent pure indica. It is indigenous to the Hindu Kush mountain chain that forms the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The meaning of the word “Kush” is disputed, and has been traced back to a Persian term for “Hindu killer” (in reference to the danger of crossing the inhospitable mountains) as well as to Avestan words meaning simply “water mountain.” In any case, Kush has become a byword for weed and is often used a suffix in the names of different strains, regardless of whether those strains have Hindu Kush in their lineage (Source: wikileaf).</p>

  <h2>Processing:</h2>
  <p>The harsh climate of its homeland has conditioned this strain to express a thick, protective coat of crystal trichomes cherished by hash makers worldwide. Hindu Kush is marked by large, clustered green buds that adhere due to their incredibly sticky consistency. Some phenotypes have shades of purple in the leaves, the result of high concentrations of plant pigments called anthocyanins being activated by cold weather during the vegetative stage. The densely-packed flowers are famous for their resin (Hindu Kush may have been one of the first strains used to produce hash) and have a heavy coating of silver-white trichomes (Source: wikileaf).</p>
  <h2>Marketplace Infuence:</h2>
  <p>Hindu Kush induces a deep sense of calm that helps bring relief to those suffering pain, nausea, and stress disorders. A true nighttime smoke, Hindu Kush is well-suited to solo use or to small intimate gatherings (Source: wikileaf).</p>
  <h2>Genetic Note:</h2>
  <p>Subtle yet the aroma of this strain is very complex, with a simultaneously sweet and musky scent, redolent of spice, sandalwood, pine, and wet earth. The musky odor intensifies when flowers are combusted and smoked. The resulting smoke is harsh and cough-inducing; when exhaled, smoke tastes vaguely like pine. The overall flavor impression of Hindu Kush is one of incense and herbs (Source: wikileaf).</p>
  <h2>Growing/Breeding Diffuculty:</h2>
  <p>The purely indica lineage of Hindu Kush is evident in its stature. Indica plants are much shorter and stockier than their sativa counterparts, and the Hindu Kush strain epitomizes this, hardly ever growing taller than 5 feet. As such, it can be grown indoors, provided that multiple plants are spaced to allow for the strain’s wide lateral branches. Outdoor cultivation tends to be more difficult, as the strain’s native climate is highly variable. However, as noted, certain varieties of Hindu Kush have been stabilized through minor crossbreeding, so some phenotypes may grow well outdoors. Growers may want to trim low-lying branches (which can later be used to grow clones) to allow for easy air circulation. Growers should also trim broad fan leaves to allow light to penetrate to flowering nodes up and down the length of the plant. When cultivated indoors, Hindu Kush flowers anywhere between 7 to 10 weeks. If grown outside, plants are usually ready for harvest in late October. Hindu Kush can yield up to 1.5 oz per square foot and reach a THC count of up to 20% (Source: wikileaf).</p>
  Procuring Hindu Kush is a unique encounter for the cannabis novice and connoisseur alike. Shaped over countless generations of natural selection, its aromatic flowers offer a way to experience a piece of botanical and cultural history. The strain’s powerful knockout high may introduce a new kind of respect for nature -- or at the very least, an understanding of why this plant has been selectively bred by humans for centuries (Source: wikileaf).

  <h2>Processing:</h2>
  <p>Once cured, leaves from the plant’s long branches can appear sparse - they are thin and wispy and do not have the “shrunken” and compact appearance of indica and sativa hybrid buds. Leaves are forest green to dark green, with hairs that appear more brown than orange (wikileaf).</p>
  <h2>Marketplace Infuence:</h2>
  <p>Jamaican Strain, or simply Jamaican, refers to the varieties of Sativa endemic to the island of Jamaica. Although these strains are generally considered to fit the definition of a landrace, cannabis did not actually exist in Jamaica until brought over by Indian indentured servants in the 1840s and 1850s when the British Empire ruled both Jamaica and India -- in fact, the word ganja, often used in Jamaica to refer to cannabis, is a variation of the Bengali word for hemp. The plant took quickly to Jamaica’s tropical climate and has since become renowned for its potent cerebral effects. Often sought out by tourists in Jamaica, true Jamaican Strain can be difficult to come by elsewhere. A true sativa, Jamaican has pervasive cerebral qualities. The high has mellow, buzzing bodily effects but is mostly marked by stimulation of mental acuity. Euphoria and perceptions of clearer thinking are common. Those lucky enough to have enjoyed Jamaican Strain claim that they experience talkativeness and an increased feeling of sociability. This is an energizing daytime strain and beneficial for deep creative thinking. Like many landraces, Jamaican Strain is prized for its stability and potency, having yielded popular crossbred strains like Lambsbread and Marley’s Collie. However, in a market that prefers novelty crossbreeds, more traditional cannabis consumers and horticulturists consider the pure Jamaican landrace to be in danger of falling into obscurity. The 2015 High Times World Cannabis Cup was held in Negril, Jamaica, specifically to encourage the participation of local breeders and to document and preserve pure Jamaican Strains (Source: wikileaf).</p>
  <h2>Genetic Note:</h2>
  <p>Jamaican is famously pungent, with an almost eye-watering, skunky-sweet musk. The skunk scents are concentrated when this strain is burned. Users report inhaling a harsh, stinging smoke (wikileaf).</p>
  <h2>Growing/Breeding Diffuculty:</h2>
  <p>If you’re able to obtain Jamaican Strain seeds for cultivation, an outdoor growing environment is best, as plants can quickly outgrow the confines of an enclosed environment. Jamaican plants will also thrive in a tropical climate, so sharing an approximate latitude with Jamaica is a benefit. This strain is best for growers with patience, as flowering can take as long as 5 months (wikileaf).</p>

  <h1>Mexican</h1>
  <p>Mexico’s unique climate and mountainous terrain makes it one of the few global regions hospitable to growing cannabis. Mexico is home to several landrace strains, all of which have decidedly sativa characteristics thanks to the country’s high elevations. There are several distinct strains that could be called “Mexican,” many of which have proven useful in crossbreeding inventive new varieties. What follows is a summary of some of the prime characteristics associated with Mexican sativa landraces (Source: Leafly).</p>

  <h2>Processing:</h2>
  <p>In their raw, unprocessed form, genuine Mexican sativas may have a striking appearance for American consumers accustomed to bud that’s been packaged by dispensaries and delivery services. Mexican flowers are typically elongated and spindly rather than nugget-like and tightly packed. Instead of curling tightly inward, these strains’ leaves are loose and piecey and may have a fluffy appearance when viewed from afar. The leaves are a bright shade of lime green and are threaded through with brown to vibrant orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, structure meant to catch pollen from flowering male plants. Due to cold nighttime temperatures in the high altitude environment where much of Mexico’s cannabis is grown, these flowers also frequently boast blue and purple hues in their leaves -- pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genetics that are stimulated by colder than average weather. Finally, cloudy amber-colored trichomes cover these leafy buds and give them a slightly yellow glow (wikileaf).</p>
  <h2>Marketplace Infuence:</h2>
  <p>Mexican sativas can also be of use to medical cannabis patients, thanks to their mentally stimulating and mood-elevating properties. They may help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain concentration on a single task. They can also provide temporary respite from mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. The subtle anti-inflammatory properties of these varieties may soothe bodily irritations like headaches and indigestion. Because the mental effects of these strains are not particularly intense, they may be appropriate for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC. In its early stages, this mental stimulation can be helpful in aiding concentration or in making mundane chores and errands more interesting. As the high progresses, though, smokers’ mindsets can become more foggy and dreamlike and may not be as well-suited to work that demands acute focus. Some degree of physical relaxation can enable deep breathing and can eliminate any lingering muscular tension. Appetite stimulation is commonly reported. More so than with other varieties, Mexican sativas are often said to trigger a dry mouth and dry eyes. More appropriate for daytime than for evening use, Mexican bud is also said to have a shorter than average high.</p>
  <h2>Genetic Note:</h2>
  <p>Mexican cannabis has a very earthy and dank odor, with a considerably skunky pungency. There’s also a woodsy scent lurking underneath while grinding up the buds releases spicy, peppery notes. Despite this funky flavor profile, Mexican sativas tend to burn with a smooth and palatable smoke when combusted. This smoke can have a tangy, diesel scent on the exhale.</p>
  <h2>Growing/Breeding Diffuculty:</h2>
  <p>Many sources purport to sell seeds or clones of authentic Mexican landrace strains; however, consumers should investigate the reputation and reliability of any sources, as the original stock of these strains is considered rare. Once obtained, Mexican strains can be grown indoors or out, and can be particularly resistant to adverse conditions if fostered outdoors. These plants grow tall and should be contained by trimming back branches and stems early on in the vegetative process. As with many pure sativas, Mexican cannabis has a long flowering period, in this case taking as many as 16 weeks before reaching maturity.</p>
  If true Mexican landrace sativa can be obtained, it’s a must-try for any cannabis enthusiast. This unique, subtle strain has served as a parent for other popular varieties like Acapulco Gold, Trainwreck, and Haze.

  <h1>Nepalese</h1>
  <p>Known the world over as one of the original and most respected marijuana strains, Nepalese refers to any plant that’s grown in the country of Nepal. This mountainous country has used cannabis for centuries as a part of their spiritual lives and the strain is now often crossed with other plants to create the hybrid varieties we enjoy today.</p>

  <img src='https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/sativa/nepalese/badge'>
  <h2>Processing:</h2>
  <p>Nepalese strains tend to be moderately strong, with THC levels ranging between 14% and 17%. While there will be some variation from region to region, most buds are large and fluffy with thick hairs, few trichomes, and a sweet coating of resin.</p>
  <h2>Marketplace Infuence:</h2>
  <p>Given that it’s a pure sativa strain, Nepalese brings a strong high that hits you immediately. Your emotional state will be lifted to one of extreme happiness, you’ll feel more alert, and you may even find yourself rather chatty. Creativity is often enhanced as well, making it a great choice for artists and musicians. This mountainous origin strain is often crossed with other plants to create many of the hybrid varieties we enjoy today.</p>
  <h2>Genetic Note:</h2>
  <p>Citrus and lavender tend to be the most prominent notes within the strain, but hints of earth, wood, and flowers are also common.</p>
  <h2>Growing/Breeding Diffuculty:</h2>
  <p>Home growers may be surprised to find that despite its sativa roots, Nepalese grows just like an indica strain. Plants do not grow to be overly tall and are resistant to a wide range of molds, mildews, and even temperature swings. These landrace strains make great choices for a first-time cultivator, and after 8 to 9 weeks of care, you’ll end up with a pretty amazing yield. If you’re able to mirror the climate conditions of Nepal itself, the amount of bud these plants can produce is mind-boggling.</p>

  <h1>South American</h1>
  <p>South American refers to the indigenous varieties of cannabis (or landraces) that grow natively in this region of the world. Because of this region's latitude and climate, these native landrace strains tend to be sativa in structure and effect.</p>

  🍁</div>
  <img src='https://d3ix816x6wuc0d.cloudfront.net/sativa/south-american/badge'>
  <h2>Processing:</h2>
  <p>Flowers of South American stand out immediately thanks to a larger than average size and a chunky, globular shape. These buds are solid at the core, but are composed of long, feathery leaves that twist away from each other at their fringes, resulting in a loose, ragged appearance. The leaves themselves are a mossy green, although occasionally, phenotypes show off patches of pale to dark purple; these surprising hues come about thanks to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which are activated by cold weather. Finally, curly orange pistils and sticky, translucent white trichomes cap off these wild flowers.</p>
  <h2>Marketplace Infuence:</h2>
  <p>South American’s persistent mental buzz can also be useful for medical cannabis patients. Its action on the mind can allow for deep focus on single tasks, particularly for those with attention deficit disorders. Its glowing euphoria may also dull or distract from the symptoms associated with mild to moderate stress or depression. Physical benefits, while mild, may include a relief from inflammation-related discomforts like headaches or nausea. The same intraocular pressure that creates its initially constricted “headband” feeling can be especially helpful for elderly patients affected by eye conditions like glaucoma. Because its powerful sense of mind race can be disorienting, even in otherwise familiar surroundings, South American is not recommended for patients who are prone to paranoia or who have a low THC tolerance.</p>
  <h2>Genetic Note:</h2>
  <p>As fragrant as they are visually impressive, South American’s buds carry a predominantly tropical, fruity aroma with vague notes of mango and citrus. A deeper second whiff may also detect some underlying musk and pine. Grinding up the buds, meanwhile, may emit the astringent chemical tang of ammonia. When burnt, South American gives off a smooth smoke that can be easily ingested. On the exhale, this smoke mingles flavors of pine and citrus.</p>
  <h2>Growing/Breeding Diffuculty:</h2>
  <p>Seeds of this landrace strain have not been commercially harvested and are not available for sale online. Those looking to grow it at home should find a trusted source from which to obtain clippings, which can be grown as clones. Plants can thrive indoors or out -- and may do especially well at outdoor elevations in humid climates, similar to their native surroundings. Those growing indoors may need to occasionally trim their crops back in order to keep their height under control. South American can take a longer than average time to flower, at about 10 weeks.</p>

  <h2>Processing:</h2>
  <p>This pure sativa landrace is sometimes called “Thai Sticks” because of the way its buds are traditionally dried and tied into long sticks.</p>
  <h2>Marketplace Infuence:</h2>
  <p>This original Thai variety has given rise to many strains we commonly see on the market today, including Voodoo, Juicy Fruit, and the classic Haze.</p>
